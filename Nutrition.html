          <h2>Carbs</h2>
            <p>A single cup of plain whole milk yogurt contains approximately 11.4 grams of carbohydrates. Of course, the carbohydrate count will vary depending on the type of milk and flavor used in a yogurt, but largely the carbohydrate makeup comes from the natural sugars found in yogurt.</p>
          <h3>Fats</h3>
            <p>In one serving of plain whole milk yogurt, you can expect about 8 grams of fats. Swap to a low-fat yogurt or a skim milk-based yogurt for a lower fat count</p>
          <h3>Protien</h3>
            <p>Alongside other dairy-based foods, yogurt is a good source of protein. One cup brings 8.5 grams of protein.</p>
          <h4>Vitamins and Minerals</h4>
            <p>Plain yogurt is an excellent source of calcium and is high in phosphorus and riboflavin. But it also provides more naturally-occurring sugar (from lactose) and saturated fat than most people would expect to find in a "healthy" food.</p>
          <h5>Calories</h5>
            <p>There are approximately 149 calories in one cup of plain whole milk yogurt. Of course, the calorie count will ultimately differ if the yogurt has additional fruit or toppings, or is made from a different milk.
            If you are buying yogurt to include in your healthy diet, always remember to check the Nutrition Facts label and ingredients list. Some yogurt products contain just a few ingredients like milk and fruit, but others may contain quite a bit of added sugar, corn syrup, and other ingredients like corn starch or gelatin that increase the calorie count.
            And if you are comparing the calorie count of yogurt, be sure that the containers you are evaluating are the same size. Some yogurt products are lower in calories simply because the package is smaller.</p>
